#Disable Term Node Listings

## Description

By default on taxonomy term pages, Backdrop will display a teaser list of 
content that is tagged with that term, in reverse chronological order. 
*Disable Term Node Listings* allows you to selectively disable these listings 
per vocabulary. Once the listing is disabled view blocks  can be used instead
to more precisely control content and sorting.

## Configuration

Disable term listings for a particular vocabulary by going to that vocabulary's
configuration page.
